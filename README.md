# Education Inequality â€¢ Data 3320, Spring 2023
Addresses the inequality of educational opportunity in U.S. high schools. We are focusing on average student performance on the ACT or SAT exams that students take as part of the college application process and if socioeconomic factors may be used to predict school performance.

## Data
This project utilizes two data sets [`EdGap_data.xlsx`](https://github.com/lbomine/Education-Inequality/blob/main/EdGap_data.xlsx) and [`ccd_sch_029_1617_w_1a_11212017.csv`](https://www.dropbox.com/s/lkl5nvcdmwyoban/ccd_sch_029_1617_w_1a_11212017.csv?dl=0). 

The primary data set is the EdGap data set from [EdGap.org](https://www.edgap.org/#5/37.875/-96.987) which includes information about average ACT or SAT scores for schools and several socioeconomic characteristics of the school district in 2016. The secondary data set is basic information about each school from the [National Center for Education Statistics](https://nces.ed.gov/ccd/pubschuniv.asp).

## Data Preparation
Used this [Data Preparation Notebook](https://github.com/lbomine/Education-Inequality/blob/main/Education%20Inequality%20Data%20Preparation%20-%20Leiana%20Omine.ipynb) to import the data sets and prepare the data.
<br> <br> Steps Taken:
- Inspected the contents of each data set.
- Converted data types of columns of the data frames to the correct types.
- Removed unnecessary parts of the data sets.
- Identified missing values in the data sets. Imputed or removed NaN values.
- Ensured that the data frame is in a tidy, or long, format.
- Renamed the columns to follow best practices of being lowercase, snake_case, and understandable.
- Created derived variables that will be useful in the analysis.
- Exported the [clean data set](https://github.com/lbomine/Education-Inequality/blob/main/clean_education_inequality.csv).
