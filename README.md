# Education Inequality â€¢ Data 3320, Spring 2023
Addresses the inequality of educational opportunity in U.S. high schools. We are focusing on average student performance on the ACT or SAT exams that students take as part of the college application process and if socioeconomic factors may be used to predict school performance.


## Data
This project utilizes two data sets [`EdGap_data.xlsx`](https://github.com/lbomine/Education-Inequality/blob/main/EdGap_data.xlsx) and [`ccd_sch_029_1617_w_1a_11212017.csv`](https://www.dropbox.com/s/lkl5nvcdmwyoban/ccd_sch_029_1617_w_1a_11212017.csv?dl=0). 

The primary data set is the EdGap data set from [EdGap.org](https://www.edgap.org/#5/37.875/-96.987) which includes information about average ACT or SAT scores for schools and several socioeconomic characteristics of the school district in 2016. The secondary data set is basic information about each school from the [National Center for Education Statistics](https://nces.ed.gov/ccd/pubschuniv.asp).
